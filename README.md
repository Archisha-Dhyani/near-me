# near-me

## About
This will an AR-based project. Imagine it as a mix of google lens and google maps functions. The best way to describe it would be in a form of a lens which will show you all the places nearby, their short description, type, timings etc. With one click on the screen you would find the location and the navigation to that place also. We would be using the google maps API for it all. This app is dedicated to all the explorers, adventures and to finding new places.
